laststand
=========

A Bukkit plugin for Minecraft; allows players stay alive in a weak state of "dying" after their health reaches 0, wherein another player can revive them. Based on the CoD "last stand" perk.

See the project at http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/laststand/

I'm posting this because I'm not sure how much time I'll have for Bukkit and Minecraft in the near future, so please feel free to add and improve if it falls behind. Please cite me as the original author, and avenge me!

Please contact me for insight if needed but keep in mind that I won't often have a lot of time to answer in great detail.
